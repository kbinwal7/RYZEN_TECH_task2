<h2>MUSHROOM CLASSIFICATION</h2>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<h3>
  This project is aimed at building a machine learning model to classify mushrooms based on their features into edible or poisonous categories. It utilizes the <a href="./data_bc.csv">dataset</a> which contains various attributes of mushrooms such as cap shape, cap color, odor, etc., and their corresponding classes.<br/><hr>
</h3>

<h2>Features:</h2><ul>
  <h3>
    <li>Preprocessing of the dataset to handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and scale features. </li>
<li>Training of machine learning models including Decision Trees, Random Forests. </li>
<li>Evaluation of model performance using various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.</li> 
<li>Saving and loading trained models for inference.</li></ul><br><hr>
